# FingerPrint_Sensor_R307

pip install pyfingerprint


Description

This is the R307 Fingerprint Sensor Module with a TTL UART interface for direct connections to microcontroller UART or to PC through MAX232 / USB-Serial adapter. The user can store the fingerprint data in the module and can configure it in 1:1 or 1: N mode for identifying the person. The FP module can directly interface with 3.3 or 5v Microcontroller. A level converter (like MAX232) is required for interfacing with PC serial port. Integrated image collecting and algorithm chip together, All-in-one Fingerprint reader can conduct secondary development, can be embedded into a variety of end products. Users can conduct secondary development, can be embedded into a variety of end products, such as access control, attendance, safety deposit box, car door locks

The R307 Fingerprint Sensor Module has low power consumption, low cost, small size, excellent performance, Professional optical technology, precise module manufacturing technics. Good image processing capabilities can successfully capture an image up to resolution 500 dpi Finger detection function.

Pinouts :

 5V : Regulated 5V DC
 GND : Common Ground
 TXD : Data output – Connect to MCU RX
 RXD : Data Input – Connect to MCU TX
 TOUCH : Active Low output when there is touch on sensor by finger
 3.3V : Use this wire to give 3.3V to sensor instead of 5V
USB Cable Connections are 5V/D+/D-/GND (Optional)
